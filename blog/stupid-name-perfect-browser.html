    <p>Welcome to my first ever blog! I know no one will read it but it's okay i dont really care, no one listens to me
        anyway... /j</p>
    <p>Today i will talk about my new main browser called "Floorp"! Floorp is a fork of Mozilla Firefox which is pretty
        cool for people who enjoy browsers that dont take up 129 gigs of ram :)</p>
    <p>It's also pretty cool because it's not a chromium fork, and chromium is a spyware made by google, so it's pretty
        cool to have a browser that's not a spyware.</p>
    <p>It's basically vivaldi but for Firefox. It include very nice features (which are not plugin based but baked into
        the browser directly) such as a robust tracking blocker, fingerprinting protection, regular updates (every 4
        weeks since based on ESR). It also include a lot of customizability options that go beyond Firefox CSS.</p>
